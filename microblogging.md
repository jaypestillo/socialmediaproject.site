## Twitter & Microblogging

I believe for this comparison it’s best to start with the definition of microblogging. An online medium used for making short frequent posts. Twitter is categorized as being a microblogging service. In comparing Twitter to alternative social media microblogging platforms. You begin to discover the uniqueness of Twitter and its user interface design. This uniquely different method of interreacting with information, I believe changes the general thought process of an individual that’s interacting with the platform.
To start, I feel as though Twitter has successfully developed a method of traveling down a rabbit hole. Its method of retweeting and chaining tweets, as you even demonstrated in this week’s lecture, gives Twitter the ability to keep users consuming informational content. Keeping users moving among pages and posts to consumer more information; increasing the time a user spends on their application. Other social media microblogging platforms have methods of retaining and even increasing user time spent on their applications. As well as increasing and chaining together content across pages and posts to give users new content. However, the surprising difference with Twitter is that sometimes you won’t even know that you’re switching between the site’s different pages and posts because it all flows together so seamlessly. The only other social media platform that I believe to have a similar method of delivering content to its users in this way is TikTok. TikTok seems to have a similar approach of quickly moving users across pages and posts.
Another difference that Twitter has when compared to other social media microblogging platforms is that it's not structured for remaining on a single piece of content for a long time. The most obvious sign is the character limit of posts. Another more subtle difference that I see specifically when compared to Facebook is that Twitter doesn’t contain long video content. It mostly has short video snippets. Keeping users moving to new content across the platform quickly.
