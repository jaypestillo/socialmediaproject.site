## Pinterest & Social Media

While conducting this comparison, thinking about ideologies and understanding how ideologies can explain unequal social relations, helps make sense of Pinterest’s disproportionate gender userbase. This gender disproportion has been reported in multiple articles. Becoming a topic worth understanding or better yet attempting to make sense of. The website Statista, reports that the distribution of Pinterest users worldwide as of January 2022, by gender has 76.7% of female users (Statista). This is unique when compared to other social media platforms we’ve discussed throughout this course.

One thought that doesn’t precisely explain the reason for a higher female user base as opposed to male is simply perception. It’s almost like an ideology surrounds Pinterest. Which individuals perceive, leading them to make and even contribute to assuming the social media platform is for females. It’s like an important piece of Pinterest’s identity has been forgotten or ignored. Relating this to something mentioned previously in the course, the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge. This challenge went viral across social media spreading among all sorts of different people. Nearly everyone that utilized social media at one point or another was presented with this challenge. However, the reason for the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, being to raise money for ALS was quickly lost or forgotten as the Ice Bucket Challenge spread across all social media platforms.

Pinterest to me is an example of how social media can sometimes take the shape of what users alongside creators and developers desire a social media platform to become. It serves as an example of how individual perceptions, guided by a greater ideology can shape an understanding, that might not be correct.
