## Facebook & Television Comparison

In my comparison, I chose to use Facebook and cable television. For this comparison, I utilized my friend's Facebook as I don’t have my own. The television was standard cable television that was broadcasted in Italy.  

The similarity between these two mediums that immediately struck me was the small sense that you were in control of what you were consuming. While watching television, you feel like you’re the one changing channels and stopping at the channels that interested you. While browsing Facebook you were able to stop at content that interested you as you scroll through your personalized feed. Both media sources allow you to feel like you’re the one choosing the content you’re consuming. To a very minimal extent you are in control, but, both media sources have either chosen or have an analytical method of showing you content.  

Another similarity between the two media sources that I noticed was the sense of relaxation. Specifically, how both media sources are utilized to relax or better yet disconnect from the moment. This seemed easier with television as it would draw you into whatever content was being shown. Facebook was a bit more difficult, seeming to do the opposite for me as it had the content of friends leading me to place more thought into what that person was saying, doing, or resharing. Scrolling Facebook started off relaxing but also had a sense of tying me to new patterns of thinking surrounding my friend’s content. On the other hand, television, depending on what I was watching, allowed me to better disconnect from reality.  

Lastly, I think the most obvious difference that I noticed existing between the two media sources was the social aspect. This was somewhat obvious as the television would only allow for the broadcasting of content and information. Facebook allows for the interaction and contribution of content through sharing, liking, and posting, while also consuming its media.
Overall, the two mediums have quite a few similarities but have a significant difference as one is a social media source, and the other is simply a source of media.
