## LinkedIn & Social Media

LinkedIn is a social media platform, unlike any others that we’ve learned about thus far in the course. The intent of the social media platform is different from the others we’ve been discussing. LinkedIn is defined as a social networking site designed for the business community. This difference in the intent of the social media platform is what I’d argue makes the platform unique from others.  

With the intent differing you see it change the layout of the social media platform. It’s like other social media sites in that it has you create a personal profile; detailing things about yourself but in the case of LinkedIn. It focuses your profile on your professional career. The focus of your profile is on your educational background, work experience, and professional accomplishments.  

When it comes to the feed section it depends on whom you connect with or follow, but it’s mostly surrounding business. Whether it's motivational, an accomplishment of your connection, or an announcement; It’s generally about business. The more interesting part about LinkedIn. What I believe is unique and further differentiates it from other media sources is the way that it integrates learning and certifications. This I believe is a newer feature that’s been added to LinkedIn over the years, but it’s worked to not only separate LinkedIn from other social media platforms as the business-centric social media platform. It works to integrate the social media platform into another area of business.  

LinkedIn Learning is a subsidiary of LinkedIn that provides video courses in software, creativity, and business skills. It’s a paid service that either an individual can subscribe and pay for or it can be purchased at an organizational level and provided to the organization's employees. LinkedIn learning being a subsidiary of LinkedIn makes the linking of course completion and certifications to an individual’s profile even easier. In summary, it’s a great extension into more business for the social media platform LinkedIn.
