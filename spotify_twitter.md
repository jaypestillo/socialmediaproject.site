## Spotify & Twitter

Comparing Spotify and Twitter I find it interesting as I feel like they’re very different forms of media. I say media because I feel like Spotify isn’t social media. It’s a media source that incorporates the option of sharing personal content with others, having a social component. This differs from Twitter, being a social media platform built for individuals to connect and share information and content with friends and others. The purpose of Spotify isn’t to connect people with others. Instead, it’s meant to stream audio. This alone stands out as a large difference from Twitter as well as many other social media platforms where the intent is to connect individuals.
The reason I find comparing Spotify and Twitter interesting is that the type/intent of media has a completely different effect on the individual that uses the service. Twitter is a compilation of informational content that you, your friends, and the general user base of the social media source are interested in. Spotify is an archive of audio from artists, that you’re able to search, find, and listen to. With the ability to search for audio you’re able to share that content with friends and the general user base of the media source. Making the social aspect of Spotify a feature, not the sole intent.
I wanted to discover where I’d first heard the concept I’ll attempt to describe below or at least an article of some sort explaining the theory, but I was unable to find anything while searching. Leaving me to explain the concept the best I can. An individual that advocates against many large social media platforms, after previously working for one. Mentioned the hypothetical future shift of social media drifting from being a general-purpose to being more specialized based on the user base's interest. An example of the type of social media this individual was speaking about is Strava. Strava is described as an internet service used for tracking physical exercise which incorporates social networking features. I use Strava to track my exercise activities. However, I don’t see this as or use it as a means of social media. Spotify could in some sense be categorized as a type of specialized form of social media.
