## Social Gaming & Social Media

For this comparison, I chose to utilize Twitch. In high school, I use to game but since haven’t spent much time in front of a gaming console. Ironically, I’ve always enjoyed watching video games being played; since much of my childhood was spent watching my brother play single-player video games. Watching Twitch for me was enjoyable overall.
What was noticeable to me immediately was the similarity to YouTube being a video platform. When you click on a video and begin watching you notice the advertisement of other videos below the video playing as well as other channels' recommendations on the left-hand of the screen. One detail I immediately noticed, making a mental note of was the ‘LIVE’ icon in the top left corner of the video playing. This to me represented a distinction from other social media platforms we’ve looked at thus far. Other social media platforms have methods of broadcasting live media or video content, but none that focus on live media content as much as Twitch. The ‘LIVE’ icon served as a similarity to sports. Much like ESPN that broadcasts sports with commentators like some of the content I watched on Twitch.
Another noticeable difference I found with Twitch compared to other social media platforms is that it allowed you to start utilizing a large portion of the platform immediately without having to create an account. I was able to access the platform and begin consuming the video content without signing into an account or creating one. Again, this is like YouTube more than the previous social media platforms we’ve discussed. I feel like the reason for this difference is that Twitch is designed as a social media platform mainly for consumption, not for creating content. Video commercial advertisements are also consumed like television. Twitch in general I would describe as a modern form of television for the younger generation.
